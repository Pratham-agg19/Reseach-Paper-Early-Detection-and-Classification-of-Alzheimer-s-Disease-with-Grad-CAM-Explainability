Overview
In this research, we aim to detect and classify Alzheimer's Disease at an early stage using MRI scans, leveraging multiple machine learning and deep learning approaches. The models used include:

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Ensemble Model

CNN with Fine-Tuning (Best performance: 95% accuracy)

Combined CNN Model

Additionally, Grad-CAM visualizations are applied to provide explainability and interpretability to the deep learning models, helping to highlight the important regions in MRI scans that contribute to classification.
